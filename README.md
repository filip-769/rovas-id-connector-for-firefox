**Installation**

Please note that this extension is currently released in developer mode and is not yet packaged. To install it, you will need to load it as an "unpacked" extension in Chrome.

Prerequisites: 
- Google Chrome (or Chrome based Openstreetmap App)
- ROVAS Account: You must be a registered user in the [ROVAS App](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://neofund.sk/rovas-api%23) and have your API KEY and TOKEN (available on your account page).

**Steps to Install**

1.	Prepare the Extension Files:
    - Create a new folder on your computer (e.g., ROVAS_Connector_Extension).
    - Download all files from this GitHub repository (the manifest.json, content.js, background.js, popup.html, popup.js, and the icon16.png, icon48.png images) and place them directly inside this new folder. Make sure manifest.json is at the very top level of this folder, not inside a subfolder.

2.	Open Chrome Extensions Page:
